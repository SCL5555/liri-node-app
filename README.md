#  Purpose
This project demonstrates how to call APIs using node and npm packages from the command line

#  Getting Started
To get started you can type any of the following commands 'my-tweets', 'spotify-this-song', 'movie-this', 'do-what-it-says'.  'my-tweets' will pull the latest 20 tweets from user SarahC Stauber.  'spotify-this-song' accepts a song name as a parameter and while return attributes related to the song, if no song is given it will default to 'Bye Bye Bye'.  'movie-this' accepts a movie name as a parameter and will return attributes related to the movie, if no movie is given it will default to 'Gone in 60 seconds'.  'do-what-it-says' will read a command from a txt file and execute it.
